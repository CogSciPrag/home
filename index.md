<h1>Welcome to the CogSciPrag homepage!</h1>
<p>

We are the Cognitive Science & Pragmatics group (CSP lab), at the Department of Linguistics, University of TÃ¼bingen. We study pragmatic reasoning, i.e., how language is interpreted and produced in different contexts of use.
Our work takes the interdisciplinary perspective of computational cognitive science and includes diverse methods --- theoretical work, formal and experimental pragmatics, probabilistic cognitive modeling, neural language models, cognitive & evolutionary modeling, mechanistic interpretability methods and more.
