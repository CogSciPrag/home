<h1>Welcome to the CogSciPrag homepage!</h1>
<p>
  We are the Cognitive Science & Pragmatics group (CSP lab), at the Department of Linguistics at the University of TÃ¼bingen. We study how pragmatic language is interpreted and produced, and how different aspects of context and the agents' cognitive mechanisms influence those processes.
  We are interested in pragmatic language use both by humans and language models.
  We approach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective of computational Cognitive Science. 
  Our work includes diverse methods --- theoretical work, probabilistic cognitive modeling, neural language models, web-based experiments with human participants, cognitive modeling, mechanistic interpretability methods.
