<h1>Welcome to the CogSciPrag homepage!</h1>
<p>
  We are the Cognitive Science of Pragmatics group, CogSciPrag, at the University of TÃ¼bingen. Our goal is to broadly understand how natural language is interpreted and produced, and how these processes are guided by different aspects of context and the agents' cognitive mechanisms. We approach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective of Cognitive Science. Our methods and interests include probabilistic modeling, work with Large Language models, web-based experiments with human participants, frameworks combining cognitive and neural models, and more.
