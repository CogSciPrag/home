<h3>Cognitive Science & Pragmatics</h3>
<p>

The Cognitive Science & Pragmatics group (CSP lab), located at at the Department of Linguistics, University of TÃ¼bingen, studies pragmatic reasoning, i.e., how language is interpreted and produced in different contexts of use.
The CSP lab takes the interdisciplinary perspective of computational cognitive science and includes diverse methods --- theoretical work, formal and experimental pragmatics, probabilistic cognitive modeling, neural language models, cognitive & evolutionary modeling, mechanistic interpretability methods and more.
