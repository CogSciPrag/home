<h1>Welcome to the CogSciPrag homepage!</h1>
<p>
    * [ ] We are the Cognitive Science of Pragmatics group (CSP lab) at the Department of Linguistics of the University of TÃ¼bingen. Broadly, our goal is to understand how natural language is interpreted and produced, and how these pragmatic processes are guided by different aspects of context and general cognitive mechanisms. We approach these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective of Cognitive Science. Our methods and interests include probabilistic and evolutionary modeling, formal and experimental pragmatics, causation & causal cognition, language modeling, frameworks combining cognitive and neural models, and more.
