    description: Causal information is crucial for our understanding of the world. However, most of it isn't communicated explicitly (e.g., A causes B), but is inferred from non-causal language (e.g., If A, then B) or correlational language. We investigate which contextual factors influence these causal inferences and develop novel probabilistic models of causal language interpretation (e.g., <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9p29w77n">Lassiter & Franke, 2024</a>).

    description: Probabilistic cognitive models have helped successfully explain many phenomena in human cognition at the computational level, including how humans interpret and produce pragmatic utterances. However, such models often face a challenge in scalability to more open-ended situations and utterances, because they often rely on manually specified spaces of reasoning alternatives. We combine the explanatory strength of computational cognitive models with the flexibility of recent language models to explore more open-ended cognitive models that can explain more open-ended pragmatic language use (e.g., <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf/663bf35649ff2aeb9f3ca254833437df34bde2aa.pdf">Tsvilodub, Franke & Carcassi, 2024</a>; <a href="https://openpublishing.library.umass.edu/scil/article/id/3187/">Tsvilodub, Hawkins & Franke, 2025</a>).  
  - title: Pragmatic capabilities of humans and language models

    description: Humans effortlessly use language pragmatically, i.e., going beyond its literal meaning by relying on interlocutors' inferences in context. Additionally to knowledge of language, this capability in humans is supported by probabilistic mechanisms for reasoning about other people, rich world knowledge, and more. We investigate diverse phenomena in pragmatic language and work on new probilistic models explaining these phenomena. We also investigate to which extent language models already are capable of interpreting and generating pragmatic language, and crucially, how these capabilities should be assessed.

We focus on understanding pragmatic language interpretation and production. We are looking at meaning of natural language that goes beyond literal meaning, constructed from context, world knowledge etc., and is used by agents, human or artificial, to achieve various goals. We are also interested in psycholinguistics and cognitive modeling, as well as investigating to which extent there are parallels between human language use and the performance of recent neural language models .

We highly value interdisciplinary perspectives, open science and reproducibility in our work. Some tools and resources we use in out projects that were developed by the lab and affiliated collaborators can be found [here](https://cogsciprag.github.io/home/resources).
