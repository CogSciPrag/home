    description: Michael usually self-identifies as a computational cognitive scientist interested in higher cognition and language in particular. He has a background in cognitive science, logic and game-theory, and he's very happy when he can use Bayesian data analysis to fit bespoke, theoretically informed probabilistic models to empirical data.

    description: I’m an Assistant Professor and Lecturer at the Seminar für Sprachwissenschaft at Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen. My research focuses on the semantics and pragmatics of natural language. In particular, I am interested in different types of meaning (asserted, presupposed, not-at-issue, etc.) and how they interact with sentence- and discourse-level phenomena. My research is rooted in traditional linguistic theory, but looks to incorporate insights from neighboring fields, including philosophy, psychology, mathematics, and computer science, in order to refine and deepen our understanding of linguistic phenomena.

    description: I am a third-year PhD student. In my projects I work towards understanding how neural language models inclduing LLMs generate pragmatic natural language and which aspects contribute to this capacity. My approach is influenced by my training in Cognitive Science and combines methods from psycholnguistics as well as state-of-the-art NLP and AI. Currently I look at models for pragmatic grounded natural language generation and open-ended question answering.

    description: I am a second-year PhD student in General Linguistics. I Work on a PhD project titled "Understand Pragmatic Reasoning about Causal Relationships using Bayesian modeling".

    description: First year PhD student in Computational Linguostics. I am interested in Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Langue Models and I am working on how causal inner workings of such models could relate to human cognitive processes.

    description: Ari is a PhD student, based at ZAS Berlin. She's broadly interested in how we modulate and coordinate on meaning components that are shared 'between the lines'. In her doctoral project, she is approaching this through the lens of so-called metalinguistic operators, like the negation in "Mary didn't *stop* smoking, since she never started". She also enjoys thinking about the depth-charge illusion, assorted curiosities from Marathi, and the probabilisticness of apparently everything. At the moment, her preferred tools are mostly formal and experimental.
