    description: Michael usually self-identifies as a computational cognitive scientist interested in higher cognition and language in particular. He has a background in cognitive science, logic and game-theory, and he's usually very happy when he can use Bayesian data analysis to fit bespoke, theoretically informed probabilistic models to empirical data.

      alt: Todd Snider
    description: Todd is a postdoc in the lab, with a background in semantics and pragmatics. He's especially interested in different types of meaning (asserted, presupposed, not-at-issue, etc.) and how they interact with sentence- and discourse-level phenomena like anaphora. His favorite projects bring insights from philosophy, psychology, mathematics, and computer science into contemporary linguistic theory.

      alt: Polina Tsvilodub
    description: Polina is a senior PhD student. She has a cognitive science background, and is excited about understanding pragmatic, goal-directed language generation and interpretation, both in humans and machines. Her work uses a combination of human experimental research, LLM studies, and strives to develop frameworks for combining computational cognitive models and LLM modules for explaining more open-ended pragmatic language use.

      alt: Hening Wang
    description: Hening is a PhD student with a background in Psycholinguistics, Semantics and Pragmatics. He is affiliated with the Linguistic Meaning and Bayesian Modeling (LMBayes) project at the Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics (ZAS), part of the Leibniz Association <a href="https://www.leibniz-zas.de/de/forschung/forschungsbereiche/semantik-pragmatik/lmbayes">. His research focuses on understanding pragmatics in causal communication, combining experimental and computational approaches. Outside of research, he enjoys snowboarding and motorbiking â€” but strongly dislikes .DS_Store.

    description: Amir is a first year PhD student in Computational Linguistics. He is interested in Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models and working on how causal inner workings of such models could relate to human cognitive processes.

      alt: Ari Joshi
    description: Ari is a PhD student, based at ZAS Berlin. She's broadly interested in how we modulate and coordinate on meaning components that are shared 'between the lines'. In her doctoral project, she is approaching this through the lens of so-called metalinguistic operators, like the negation in "Mary didn't *stop* smoking, since she never started". She also enjoys thinking about the depth-charge illusion, assorted curiosities from Marathi, and the probabilisticness of apparently everything. At the moment, her preferred tools are mostly formal and experimental.
